# 📚 RAG-Based Academic Research Assistant

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered academic research assistant built using Streamlit, Ollama, and ChromaDB.

This system retrieves relevant research papers from an ArXiv dataset using semantic similarity search and generates structured, context-grounded academic responses using a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM).

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a modular RAG pipeline that:

- Performs semantic retrieval over research abstracts
- Generates structured academic responses
- Reduces hallucination through retrieval grounding
- Runs fully locally using Ollama
- Provides measurable evaluation metrics

The system achieved an evaluated **67% overall accuracy** based on structured testing.
